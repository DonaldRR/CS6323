This is a course project of CS6323 aiming to build a game in 3D scene. Alongside the game model which includes 3D object building, rendering, physical simulation and so on,
reinforcement learning is included to learn intelligent strategy for self-playing purpose.

## Framework

This project composes two parts: `3D world` implemented with C++ and `strategy` with Python. Two programs are communicated with socket connection. To run the game, go and read the code.
